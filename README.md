# Mayday! Mayday!

## Project Description
   Our project is about a spaceship whose engine nearly dies! We have to help that spaceship get to the base safely. Between the route to base there will be meteors which randomly spawn and randomly move around the map and there will be the alien ship which is chasing the spaceship and every 5 seconds they will shoot the bullet to destroy us. Your task is guiding the spaceship to the base by clicking on the screen and trying to avoid all the collisions. You have 3 hearts, which means that you can let the spaceship hit another thing 2 times and the 3rd time you will lose the game!. But if you can go to the base safely all hearts will recover for the next level. <br>
There are three levels in this game:<br>
Level 1: There will be just meteors on the map, which will spawn every second.<br>
Level 2: There will be alien ships chasing our ship, which will spawn every 2 seconds and it will shoot bullets at the player every 5 seconds; the most are 3 alien ships and the meteor.<br>
Level 3: There will be alien ships chasing our ship, which will spawn every 2 seconds and it will shoot bullets at the player every 5 seconds; the most are 5 alien ships and the meteor.<br>
